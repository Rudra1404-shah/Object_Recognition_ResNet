# Object_Recognition_ResNet
# CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50

This project implements **Object Recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset** using the **ResNet50 deep learning architecture**.  
The model is trained to classify images into 10 categories, achieving strong performance on this benchmark dataset.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Implementation of **ResNet50** for image classification.
- Trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** (60,000 images across 10 classes).
- Preprocessing and training done in **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Includes a **Jupyter Notebook** with end-to-end training and evaluation.
- Easy to extend to custom datasets.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The trained `.keras` model file (~311 MB) is **not included in this repository** because GitHub has a 100 MB file limit. You can retrain the model locally or save it elsewhere (e.g., Google Drive, Hugging Face Hub).
